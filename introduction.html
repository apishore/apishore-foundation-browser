<p>This framework is designed to support apishore code generation technology.
It is highly customizable and focused on modularity and ability to mix with other frameworks.
It is important in case of mixing legacy code with code generated by our requirements compiler.
</p>

<p>Framework provides over 300 modules designed for high performance single page applications.</p>

<blockquote class="as-color-red">
Currently we are in process of documenting framework, we add new samples and documentation pages every day.

<h2>Why yet another css framework?</h2>
<p>
Our requirements to source code compiler generates full stack web applications.
During development we tested all popular css frameworks and faced same problems (in different combinations):
<ul>
	<li>It is hard or impossible to customize every aspect of UI</li>
	<li>Low modularity</li>
	<li>It is hard to convert requirements into visual components</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Most likely you will never use this framework in your projects. The main reason is that 
it is oriented on functionality, modularity and performance. It is not easy to use, but allows to generate
high efficient single page web applications.
</p>
<h2>Fork or customize</h2>
<p>
Framework is highly customizable via SCSS variables, but it is also under Apache license
and you are free to fork and adopt it for your needs.
